Tips to being a better engineer.

## Writing Code

### Before every PR
- Keep it small! Help other engineers break down your problems

- Treat pull requests as an an `if and only if`. Your PR says exactly what the code does and your code does exactly what the PR says.

### Before every commit
- Check naming. Naming isn't the hard part, you're smart enough to do that, it's [remembering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDvr08sCPOc) to do it consistently.

- Once again, keep it small! Makes [reverting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19032296/how-to-use-git-revert) easier.

## Communication


### Ego

My favorite definition of ego is "the unhealthy belief in our own importance" from [Ego is the Enemy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27036528-ego-is-the-enemy).
